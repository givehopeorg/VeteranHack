Rather, CERDEC is seeking innovative concepts that will provide either an entirely new military capability or will enhance existing capability by orders of magnitude (based on demonstrable relevant metrics). Offerors should be prepared to support the technical feasibility of their concept or idea, and then be prepared to demonstrate and discuss successive phases leading toward technology development. Offerors should also be prepared to propose a base effort supporting the technical feasibility of their concept or idea, and to propose pre-priced options or subsequent phases that further lead toward technology development. It is envisioned that the effort proposed will have a base effort of 12 months and an option period of 12 months or a base period of 24 months with no option. Offerors should not propose total efforts exceeding 24 months. &lt;br&gt;",

description: "IARPA invests in high-risk, high-payoff research that has the potential to provide our nation with an overwhelming intelligence advantage over future adversaries. This BAA solicits abstracts/proposals for the Office for Anticipating Surprise (OAS).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OAS focuses on characterizing and reducing uncertainty through anticipatory intelligence. OAS is pursuing innovative new technology approaches that provide decision makers with timely and accurate forecasts of significant global events. This BAA solicits research that explores or demonstrates the feasibility of revolutionary concepts that may deliver real-time indications and warning, in context, to support rapid, nuanced understanding by intelligence consumers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Research areas of particular interest to OAS include:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull;	Detection and forecasting of emergent phenomena (e.g., application of technical innovation and its adoption, novel cyber-attack methods, emerging infectious diseases).&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull;	Automated generation and maintenance of taxonomies (e.g., scientific taxonomies, socio-political event taxonomies) across multiple facets. For example, research disciplines, applications, and methods could be different facets of a scientific taxonomy.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull;	Analysis and forecasting of rare events (e.g., catastrophic military conflicts, terrorist attacks, and pandemics).&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull;	Quantitative risk assessments of emerging dual-use technologies.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull;	Causal inference from observational data.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull;	Methods for assessing capability and intent to develop weapons of mass destruction (WMD). This research area includes:&lt;br /&gt;o	Data and methods to forecast technical progress towards development of critical sub-components of a WMD capability;&lt;br /&gt;o	Data and methods to detect and/or forecast major policy shifts of foreign governments, especially with respect to development of WMD.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull;	Methods for assessing capability and intent to leverage cyber capabilities against U.S. critical infrastructure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This announcement seeks research ideas for topics that are not addressed by emerging or ongoing IARPA programs or other published IARPA solicitations. It is primarily, but not solely, intended for early stage research that may lead to larger, focused programs through a separate BAA in the future, so periods of performance generally will not exceed 12 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Offerors should demonstrate that their proposed effort has the potential to make revolutionary, rather than incremental, improvements to intelligence capabilities. Research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice is specifically excluded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;",

Abstracts shall identify the specific topic area that the submission addresses. Each abstract must be specific to one of the topic areas. Multiple submissions are acceptable. Abstracts will be evaluated on relevance and merit. The abstract may be supplemented by resumes and lists of relevant publications and prior experience with the technology and/or methodology. The abstracts will be evaluated thoroughly by a Government Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) to select technologies and methodologies that have potential benefits to the Navy. The TEB will consist of engineers, scientists, chemists, environmental specialists, and regulatory agency personnel who have experience in specific environmental technology areas. The abstracts will not be evaluated against each other since each possesses a unique technology with no common work statement. When an abstract aligns with a customer need and funding, the NAVFAC contracting office may request a full proposal. Additional guidance will be provided at that time, regarding cost and pricing submittals in addition to a more comprehensive technical submission. Technical Evaluation: Unsuccessful abstracts will not receive a detailed description of the reasons for abstract rejection due to the anticipated volume of submissions. Unsuccessful full proposals will receive a debriefing in accordance with FAR 15. Awards will be in the form of contracts. Average contract duration is one (1) to three (3) years. The government may choose to fund a base period with options. The abstracts will be evaluated based on the following CRITERIA, of approximately equal weight. 1). TECHNICAL APPROACH: The scientific/technical merits and objectives of the abstract, in terms of Naval relevance. All proposals must demonstrate an approach that will achieve a DOD technology readiness level (TRL) of 5/6, and successfully manage risk while achieving technological advance. Provide an explicit, detailed description of the approach. If options are required describe appropriate research activities which would commence for subsequent options. The abstract should indicate what tasks are planned, how and where the work will be conducted, a schedule of major events, and the final product(s) to be delivered. Offeror’s effort should attempt to determine the technical feasibility of the proposed concept. The methods planned to achieve each objective or task should be discussed in detail. This section should be a substantial portion of the abstract. 2). PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR’S and KEY MEMBER’S RELATED EXPERIENCE: The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the principal investigator, team leader, and/or key personnel who are critical in achieving the objectives of the abstract. Principal investigators and key personnel should be identified in the proposal as such. 3). SAFETY: NAVFAC requires the offeror to provide their EMR and DART ratings. Safety is an integral and important part of NAVFAC contracting. If the offeror does not have an EMR/DART rating, they should state this and provide the rationale. See NFAS 15.304. 4). OFFEROR’S EXPERIENCE: The contractors capabilities related experience, techniques, or unique combination of these that are integral factors in achieving the contractors proposed objectives.

description: "&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT&lt;br /&gt;INTENT TO ESTABLISH GOVERNMENT-UNIVERSITY PARTNERSHIP(S)&lt;br /&gt;IN RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS&lt;br /&gt;FOR THE NAVAL AIR WARFARE CENTER AIRCRAFT DIVISION&lt;br /&gt;N00421-15-R-0020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. INTRODUCTION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Airworthiness department is soliciting white papers from universities, colleges, and educational research institutes to pursue agreements to research revolutionary capabilities for US Naval forces to mature and transition advances in Airworthiness Assessment tools. This is to improve US Naval capabilities, respond to current critical needs, and maintain broad technology investments to anticipate and counter potential technology surprises. To support this mission, the white paper must provide Airworthiness Assessment solutions and potential tools that will enable the future force while simultaneously seizing opportunities to enhance current readiness. White papers must also discuss the potential commercial applications of the proposed development and its impact on the market.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These efforts will be conducted primarily at the agreement holder&apos;s site but NAVAIR facilities may also be available and/or used depending on project needs. Access and use of NAVAIR facilities will require security clearances and US citizenship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. BACKGROUND&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Innovation fuels economic growth, the creation of new industries, companies, jobs, products and services, and the global competitiveness of U.S. industries.&amp;nbsp; One driver of successful innovation is technology transfer, in which the private sector adapts Federal research for use in the marketplace. &lt;br /&gt;The purpose of this broad agency announcement is to advance basic and applied research in support of Naval Aviation. By establishing these collaborative agreements the overall ability to conduct research needed to solve current and future technological challenges pertinent to Navy Airworthiness will be addressed. The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) is interested in technologies and proposals, which will demonstrate potential improvements in Airworthiness assessments.&amp;nbsp; The demonstrations and research shall be in direct support of the Navy&apos;s Airworthiness Division. Airworthiness is the property of an air system configuration to safely attain, sustain and terminate (&apos;complete&apos; in case of UAS) flight in accordance with approved usage limits. The issuance of a Navy Flight Clearance is contingent upon having the major tenets of airworthiness satisfied and ensures air vehicles and capabilities can be operated safely within defined operating limits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The research to be performed shall be directed towards the discovery of new approaches that promise to streamline the airworthiness process for augmenting the capabilities of the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) and its Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD). Activities shall include but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;* Conducting research in current and emerging future technologies.&lt;br /&gt;* Teaming with academia and DOD agencies to find the most appropriate solution to current and future war fighter requirements. &lt;br /&gt;* Promoting technology transfer using NAVAIR facilities including assessment tools&lt;br /&gt;* Providing technical assistance and training associated with assessment tools.&lt;br /&gt;* Conduct select airworthiness studies, to develop new tools for airworthiness assessment, and to conduct basic and applied research of new approaches that promise to streamline the airworthiness process for augmenting the capabilities of the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) and its Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD).

The storage facility for the cloth is in a depot in Lansing, MI. The destination for the Army Coats is (VSTQ), Pendergrass, GA. &lt;p&gt;The solicitation will be issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside that will result in a firm fixed price contract, Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantity Type Contract. This is a Best Value acquisition with Source Selection Procedures. The following factors will be utilized in descending order of importance: Production Demonstration Model (PDM) and Past Performance Confidence Assessment. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. As other evaluation factors become more equal, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Government anticipates that the number of most highly-rated proposals that might otherwise be included in the competitive range will exceed the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted. The Contracting Officer may conduct the technical evaluation using a two-phase process, as contained in the Addendum to provision 52.212-2, Additional Source Selection Evaluation Procedures (applicable to Commercial Item Acquisitions only) or Section M (applicable to other than Commercial Item Acquisitions only). During the first phase of this evaluation process, all offerors&apos; Product Demonstration Models (PDMs) and proposed prices will be evaluated. Those offerors who have submitted PDMs that are most highly rated and who have submitted price proposals that are realistic and competitive with other offerors who have submitted most highly rated PDMs will then be evaluated in the second phase of this evaluation process for the remaining technical evaluation factors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Government does not intend to use FAR part 12 for this acquisition. Reference Numbered Notes 1, 9, and 26.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Availability of solicitations, FAR 5.102(d) applies, as our office no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form.

description: "This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Naval Facilities Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center (NEXWC) under FAR 6.102(d)(2) and 35.106. A formal Request for Proposals (RFP), other solicitation, or additional information regarding this announcement will not be issued. This announcement is open for one year from the date of publication. Proposals may be submitted at any time during this period. This announcement replaces N39430-14-R-1423. FAR Part 35 restricts the use of BAAs to the acquisition of basic and applied research, and that portion of advanced technology development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement. Contracts made under BAAs are for scientific study and experimentation directed towards advancing the state of the art and increasing knowledge or understanding. This announcement is not for the acquisition of technical, engineering, or other types of support services. This announcement seeks out technologies and methodologies to reduce environmental impacts from current and past Navy operations, and applies to Navy installations worldwide. NAVFAC EXWC is interested in environmental technologies and methodologies that are either new, innovative, advance the state-of-the-art, or increase knowledge or understanding of a technology or methodology. The technology or methodology shall address one of the following topic areas. TOPIC NO. 1: ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT, RESTORATION AND CLEANUP. Services to assess and/or remediate existing pollution generated by military operations, including methodologies for evaluation of ecological risk, risk reduction, and/or establishing risk based cleanup goals. TOPIC NO. 2: CONSERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES. Practices that support habitat both on land and at sea for rare and endangered species, migratory birds or marine mammals and that comply with environmental legislation and ensure protection of sensitive resources while supporting the military operations. TOPIC NO 3: UNEXPLODED ORDNANCE (UXO). Services for explosive ordnance detection, location, de-energizing, disposal or remediation of UXO generated by military operations. TOPIC NO 4: POLLUTION PREVENTION. Process design changes, management practices or methodologies to minimize the amount of pollution generated during present or future operations and maintenance. TOPIC NO 5: ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE. Process design changes or management practices that facilitate or enhance the Navy’s ability to comply with local, state, and federal environmental regulatory requirements. TOPIC NO 6: SUSTAINABILITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE. Facility systems, process changes, or management practices that allow the Navy to perform our mission while reducing our overall environmental and economic footprint (reduce land use, energy use, water use, chemical use, and waste generation) associated with facilities. Specific areas of interest include: water conservation, greenhouse gas reduction, energy conservation, and renewable energy generation. ABSTRACT SUBMITTALS TO THIS BAA CAN BE MADE USING THE ABSTRACT FORM and INSTRUCTIONS LOCATED AT THE FOLLOWING INTERNET ADDRESS: http://www.navfac.navy.mil/navfac_worldwide/specialty_centers/exwc/products_and_services/ev/ec/baa.html Submission process: This announcement is for abstracts/white papers only. Abstracts shall identify the specific topic area that the submission addresses. Each abstract must be specific to one of the topic areas. Multiple submissions are acceptable. Abstracts will be evaluated on relevance and merit. The abstract may be supplemented by resumes and lists of relevant publications and prior government projects. Abstracts will be thoroughly evaluated by a Government Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) to select technologies and methodologies that have potential benefits to the Navy. The TEB will consist of engineers, scientists, chemists, environmental specialists, and regulatory agency personnel who have experience in specific environmental technology areas. The abstracts will not be evaluated against each other since each possesses a unique technology with no common work statement. Once the evaluation process has been completed, the abstracts that meet the basic criteria of the BAA are posted on a protected web site available for DoD use only. When an abstract aligns with a customer need and funding, the NAVFAC contracting office may request a full proposal. Additional guidance will be provided at that time, regarding cost and pricing submittals in addition to a more comprehensive technical submission. Technical Evaluation: Unsuccessful abstracts will not receive a detailed description of the reasons for abstract rejection due to the anticipated volume of submissions. Unsuccessful full proposals will receive a debriefing in accordance with FAR 15. Awards will be in the form of contracts. Government/FFRDC/UARC entities interested in responding should read NOTE 8 below. An average contract duration is one (1) to three (3) years. The abstracts will be evaluated based on the following. Factors (1), (2) and (3) are approximately equal, and when combined, are approximately equal to (4). Factors 1-4, when combined, are approximately equal to price: 1. The scientific/technical merits and objectives of the abstract, as well as Naval relevance. 2. The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the principal investigator, team leader, and/or key personnel who are critical in achieving the objectives of the abstract. Principle Investigators and key personnel should be identified in the proposal as such. 3. NAVFAC requires the offeror to provide their EMR and DART ratings. Safety is an integral and important part of NAVFAC contracting. If the offeror does not have an EMR/DART rating, they should state this and provide the rationale. See NFAS 15.304. 4. The contractors capabilities related experience, techniques, or unique combination of these that are integral factors in achieving the contractors proposed objectives. This equates to past performance, and will be assessed based on both relevance and confidence. See NFAS 15.304. 5. The cost relative to the proposed scientific/technical approach. NOTES: 1. An eligible abstract does not guarantee a contract. NEXWC reserves the right to select for award any, all, or none of the proposals received. NEXWC also reserves the right to select for award a portion of the work proposed in any single proposal. 2. An Offeror is required to register with the system for award management (SAM). No contract award will be made to any offeror that is not registered. Registration may take up to three weeks. SAM may be accessed at https://www.sam.gov. 3. The preceding data should be sufficient for completing the abstract. 4. There are no solicitation documents applying to this BAA. Request for a solicitation package will not be acknowledged. Those interested in participating in the BAA program must follow the instructions described herein to submit an abstract. 5. There is no commitment by the Navy either to make any contract awards or to be responsible for any money expended by the offeror before a contract award. 6. As no funding for contracts has been reserved in advance, NEXWC will be sharing qualified abstracts with other Federal Government activities to seek demonstration sites and/or funding. Some Federal Government activities may employ civilian contractors to determine the applicability of an offered technology to specific environmental projects. Technical and cost proposals submitted under this BAA will be protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with FAR 3.104-4 and 15.207. The cognizant Program Officer and other Government scientific experts will perform the evaluation of technical proposals. Restrictive notices notwithstanding, one or more support contractors may be utilized as subject-matter-expert technical consultants in accordance with FAR 37.204. However, proposal selection and award decisions are solely the responsibility of Government personnel. Each support contractor’s employee having access to technical and cost proposals submitted in response to this BAA will be required to sign a non-disclosure statement prior to receipt of any proposal submissions. An offeror may require the non-government personnel to execute a supplemental non-disclosure agreement by including a copy of the NDA with their proposal. However, note that a failure to come to an agreement may impact the ability to make an award. Please review NFAS/FAR 37.204 and NFAS 15.303(d)(4). 7. Responders are advised not to include Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Business proprietary or competition-sensitive information shall be marked as such. The offeror should expect to receive notification of receipt of the abstract by the Government within one week of submission. If the contractor does not receive a notification of abstract receipt, the contractor should call or e-mail NEXWC by using the phone number or e-mail address provided. 8. Historically Black Colleges/Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI) will be recognized according to DFARS 226.3. All responsible sources from academia and industry may submit proposals. No portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation, due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable items of this research for exclusive competition among the entities. Non-DOD Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) including Department of Energy National Laboratories, are not eligible to receive awards under this BAA. However, teaming arrangements between FFRDCs and eligible principal bidders are allowed so long as they are permitted under the sponsoring agreement between the Government and the specific FFRDC. DFARS 235.017-1 allows DOD FFRDCs which function primarily as research laboratories to apply. Naval laboratories and warfare centers as well as other DOD and civilian agency laboratories are not eligible to receive awards under this BAA and should not directly submit an abstract response to this BAA. As with the FFRDCs, these organizations may team with other responsible sources from industry and academia that are submitting proposals under the BAA. University Affiliated Research Centers (UARC) are eligible to submit proposals under this BAA unless precluded from doing so by their DOD UARC contract or an organizational conflict of interest. 9. Do not call the Contracting Office for verification. The abstract is not received by the Contracting Office. General contracting inquires may be directed to the FEDBIZOPS posting POC.",

description: "DLA Energy - Direct Delivery Fuels (FEPDA) intends to establish Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) with contractors, to supply and deliver Diesel, Gasoline, Aviation Jet Fuel, and AVGAS to various locations within Iraq, Jordan, and Turkey. &lt;p&gt;A Basic Ordering Agreement is a written instrument of understanding, which contains the terms and agreements under which future requirements will be solicited, evaluated, awarded and performed. A BOA is not a contract. The parties enter into a binding contract only via the issuance of a delivery order against the BOA based upon the acceptance of the agreement holder&apos;s proposal for a specific requirement. Each delivery order will be considered a unique and separate contract or purchase order.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this BOA is to negotiate in advance any exceptions your company may have to the non-price related terms and conditions contained in this solicitation. Once negotiated, these terms and conditions will be incorporated into any supply contract awarded under the BOA. Companies with BOAs will be able to respond to future solicitations for fuel requirements in Iraq, Jordan, and Turkey.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As requirements are received, BOA holders will be given the opportunity to compete based on price and any other criteria as required for performance. Non-BOA holders may compete for orders, which will be publicly posted on FedBizOpps.Gov. However, non-BOA-holders will have to respond to the base Solicitation for entering the BOA, as well as to the solicitations for placement of orders under the BOA. In cases where mission requirements would be jeopardized by holding up award for evaluation of non-price factors of non-BOA holders, DLA Energy will consider whether a BOA can be established with that contractor, and proceed to award the order to a contractor that can meet the Government&apos;s requirement. Additionally, as noted on page 2, DLA Energy will consider any contractor for evaluation to become a BOA holder over the five-year period through continually accepting proposals in response to the base Solicitation for this BOA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The period of the BOA is five (5) years from 15 April 2015 to 31 March 2020. The BOA(s) will be reviewed annually to determine if any updates are necessary. BOAs can be terminated by either party with 30 days&apos; written notice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To be eligible for award of a BOA, proposals must provide the following:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1)Signed SF 1449&lt;br /&gt;2)Certifications and Representations (See Section K under Offeror Submission Package (OSP) OR CompletedOfferor Submission Package (OSP) )&lt;br /&gt;3)A list of any exceptions to the terms and conditions of this solicitation&lt;/p&gt;",

description: "This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The purpose of this modification, W911NF-12-R-0011-03, is to update Scientific Areas of Interests, Topic Point of Contact information and administrative maintenance of the BAA. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; I.	OVERVIEW OF THE FUNDING OPPORTUNITY: &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; INTRODUCTION &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), which sets forth research areas of interest to the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) Directorates and Army Research Office (ARO), is issued under the paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which provides for the competitive selection of basic research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to this BAA and selected for award are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provision of Public Law 98-369, quote mark The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 quote mark and subsequent amendments. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Research proposals are sought from educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and commercial organizations for research in materials sciences; ballistics and aeromechanics sciences; information sciences; human sciences; survivability, lethality, and vulnerability analysis and assessment; chemistry; electronics; physics; environmental sciences; life sciences; mechanical sciences, mathematical sciences, computing sciences and network sciences. Proposals will be evaluated only if they are for scientific study and experimentation directed &lt;br&gt; toward advancing the state of the art or increasing knowledge and understanding. &lt;br&gt; ARO has primary responsibility for ARL&apos;s extramural basic research programs, with specific research interests as described in Part II.A.2. The ARL Directorates, while having primary responsibility for ARL&apos;s in-house research programs, also manage select extramural basic research programs. The research interests of the Directorates are described in Part II.A.1. Although ARL Directorates will consider funding proposals for extramural research programs, they can fund only a modest number of proposals in a single fiscal year. It should be noted that &lt;br&gt; the ARL Directorates are highly interested in performing research in collaboration with other scientists and engineers. So, in addition to funding select external research projects, the ARL Directorates also have a strong interest in performing joint research with other organizations in ARL&apos;s core competency areas as described in this BAA. Collaboration is a central tenet of ARL&apos;s new Open Campus Initiative. Information regarding the Open Campus Initiative can be found on the ARL website (a summary at: http://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?page=2357 and details regarding specific opportunities at: &lt;br&gt; http://www.arl.army.mil/www/pages/2357/ARL_Open_Campus_Opportunities.pdf). Inquiries &lt;br&gt; regarding funding and/or collaborations should be directed to the listed Technical Point of Contact (TPOC). &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Foreign owned, controlled, or influenced firms are advised that security restrictions may apply that could preclude their participation in these efforts. Before preparing a proposal, such firms are requested to contact the ARL Security and Counterintelligence Branch (301) 394-2444 concerning their eligibility. Pursuant to the policy of FAR 35.017 and supplements, selected Federally Funded Research and Development Centers may propose under this BAA. PART II, Other Programs, addresses specific contributions to Conferences and Symposia and &lt;br&gt; Historically Black Colleges &amp; Universities and Minority-Serving Institutions (HBCU/MI)support. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The Army has a long history of advocating and supporting research at HBCU and MIs.

Proposals will be evaluated only if they are for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state of the art or increasing knowledge and understanding. Proposals focused on specific devices or components are beyond the scope of this BAA. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Proposals are expected to be for cutting-edge innovative research that could produce discoveries that would have a significant impact on enabling new and improved Army operational capabilities and related technologies. The specific research areas and topics of interest described in this document should be viewed as suggestive, rather than limiting.

description: "The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, Pacific (SSC Pacific), intends to issue Request for Proposal (RFP) No. N66001-15-R-0096 for Cyberspace Science, Research, Engineering, and Technology Integration. Multiple awards are anticipated. SSC Pacific, as the principle Navy Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) and Acquisition Center for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) and Information Operations (IO) is responsible for functions that include: mission analysis; assessment and development of technology base; basic and applied research; demonstration of technology; engineering in support of production; support to operating forces; supporting doctrine, policy, and strategy development; and integration of numerous National and Tactical systems in the area of Cyberspace Operations. To meet these responsibilities, SSC Pacific requires advice, assistance, coordination and products necessary to support operational planning, assessment, integration, execution and technology development to assure superiority for the warfighter in the cyberspace domain. The full scope of this requirement is anticipated to include: technology assessment, development and transition; requirements analysis; systems engineering; operational and technical support; exercise and experimentation support; software development and prototyping; hardware development and prototyping; modeling and simulation; training support; security engineering/cybersecurity. This is a follow-on requirement to a Multiple Award Contract (MAC) of the same title: Cyberspace Science, Research, Engineering and Technology Integration. The incumbent contract numbers are N66001-11-D-0031 through -0034 and the incumbent contractors are Booz Allen Hamilton, General Dynamics - Advanced Information Systems, Northrup Grumman, and Leidos. The ordering period of the predecessor MAC is 31 January 2011 to 30 January 2016. For this requirement, a market survey to determine small business capability was posted on SPAWAR E-Commerce Central on 12 February 2015, reference number MKTSVY-OFD93E. Based upon evaluation of the responses to the market survey, SSC Pacific intends to compete the full scope of the requirement on an unrestricted basis (i.e., a full and open competition) and also compete a duplicative portion of the requirement among small businesses. The full scope of the requirement is described in Statement of Work (SOW) for the Unrestricted MAC. The small business portion of the requirement is described in the SOW for the Small Business MAC. Only small businesses can compete for the Small Business MAC. Both large and small businesses can compete for the Unrestricted MAC. It is important to note a key distinction between the intended approach and a typical partial small business set-aside. Under a typical partial small business set-aside, certain requirements are &quot;broken out,&quot; or removed from the overall requirement and competed separately. Under the intended approach, the portion of the work that small businesses can perform cannot be separated from the SOW for the unrestricted MAC. Task order requirements are expected to commonly cross multiple functional areas in the SOW. Some of these requirements will include a mixture of functional areas where small businesses are capable, as well as functional areas where small businesses are not capable. Under such requirements, the portion that small businesses can perform cannot be separated from the portion that small businesses cannot perform; these task order requirements depend on seamless integration between work in the different functional areas. To satisfy such cross- functional requirements, SSC Pacific must have access to Unrestricted MAC awardees that can perform the full scope of the SOW. Under the intended approach, the Small Business SOW duplicates a portion of the Unrestricted SOW, such that the portion small businesses can perform is included in both SOWs. This effort will be formally solicited under one RFP, which is anticipated to result in the award of both the Unrestricted MAC and the Small Business MAC. Upon identification of a new task order requirement, SSC Pacific will determine whether or not the requirement falls within the scope of the Small Business MAC. There will be a preference to use the Small Business MAC. However, if any portion of the requirement lies outside of the scope of the Small Business MAC, and if the requirement cannot be divided into smaller requirements, the requirement will be competed under the Unrestricted MAC. The SPAWAR Office of Small Business Programs concurs with this acquisition strategy. SSC Pacific received several questions in response to the market survey. The questions and answers that SSC Pacific considers pertinent are available in the Request for Information (RFI) Questions and Answers attachment to this notice. The RFI also solicited feedback on the Draft SOW. All comments received were considered and the SOWs were revised as deemed appropriate. Also attached to this notice is a List of RFI Respondents, which may be help prospective offerors network and promote subcontracting opportunities. This proposed acquisition has security requirements at the Top Secret level with incidental Secure Compartmented Information (SCI) access. The anticipated contract type will be Cost- Plus-Fixed-Fee, Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity with one three-year base period and one two-year option period. Subsequent Task Orders will be issued for individual efforts. The estimated level of effort, based upon Full Time Equivalents (FTE&apos;s), will be approximately 126 per year for the Unrestricted MAC and 30 per year for the Small Business MAC. Each FTE is estimated to be 1,920 hours per year. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330 and the Small Business Size Standard is $38.5M. The estimated value of the acquisition is $180M for the Unrestricted MAC and $40M for the Small Business MAC. SSC Pacific intends to hold an Industry Day during the summer of 2015; details regarding the Industry Day are forthcoming and will be posted at SPAWAR E-Commerce under this RFP number. SSC Pacific anticipates that the final RFP for N66001-15-R-0096 will be released in October 2015. The final RFP will only be available electronically. Electronic copies of the RFP may be obtained from the SPAWAR E-Commerce website at https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil under SSC Pacific &quot;Open Solicitations&quot;. Hard copy versions of the RFP and any subsequent amendments will not be available. Firms are encouraged to review the website regularly for important solicitation information.",

It includes all scientific study and experimentation directed toward increasing fundamental knowledge and understanding in those fields of the physical, engineering, environmental, and life sciences related to long-term national security needs. It is farsighted high payoff research that provides the basis for technological progress.&quot; (http://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/documents/fmr/Volume_02b.pdf) The DoD&apos;s basic research program invests broadly in many scientific fields to ensure that it has early cognizance of new scientific knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DoD&apos;s basic research investment in this program will also contribute to the development of the next generation of high performing scientists and engineers, who will be educated and trained as a part of the NSSEFF Fellows&apos; research. The NSSEFF program helps to ensure that our Nation has an active, long-term and aggressive research portfolio that attracts the foremost creative, innovative and productive university researchers and their students. &lt;p&gt;Objectives of the program are to:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Support scientific research that may lead to extraordinary outcomes&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Educate and train outstanding student and post-doctoral researchers for the defense and national security workforce&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Foster long-term relationships between outstanding university researchers and the DoD&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Familiarize select university researchers and their students with DoD&apos;s current and future challenges&lt;br /&gt;&amp;bull; Increase the number of exceptionally talented technical experts that are contributing to DoD&apos;s mission and are able to actively participate in its accomplishment as part of the administration of grants issued under this FOA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The NSSEFF program will focus its funding on innovative basic research projects that have the potential for significant long-term impact and support the development of the next generation of scientists and engineers for the defense and national security workforce. Risk-taking is encouraged; however, all proposals must demonstrate solid judgment and rationale. This FOA is for single investigator grant proposals for basic research in one or more of the following technical subject categories of interest to the DoD: &lt;br /&gt;1. Engineering Biology including e.g.&lt;br /&gt;a. Mammalian platforms/chassis/systems&lt;br /&gt;b. Microbial consortia engineering &lt;br /&gt;c. Genome instability&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2. Quantum Information Science including e.g.&lt;br /&gt;a. Quantum metrology&lt;br /&gt;b. Quantum algorithms&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3. Cognitive Neuroscience including e.g.&lt;br /&gt;a.

description: "THERE ARE NO FUNDS AGAINST THE BAA SOLICITATION W911QY-15-R-0025. GO TO THE FOLLOWING WEB SITE UNDER BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES TO VIEW THE ENTIRE BAA SOLICITATION FOR FULL DETAILS: http://www3.natick.army.mil/NHRC-Broad-Agency-Announcement.aspx. The Naval Health Research Center Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 15-001 identifies scientific and technical areas of interest for research and/or exploratory development. This BAA is conducted using full and open competition. In an effort to minimize proposal preparation cost, this BAA utilizes a two-step process. The first step will be the submission of a concept paper. Offerors that submit concept papers that are consistent with the intent of the BAA, and are of interest to the government will be invited to submit a proposal (step two). Such an invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Instructions for the submission of concept papers and proposals are contained in the BAA. The submission of a concept paper is required prior to the submission of a proposal. Failure to follow this two-step process may preclude the chance for award. Proposals submitted in response to the BAA will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in the BAA. Technical evaluations will employ a peer or scientific review process. A proposal&apos;s technical evaluation and its importance to agency programs, along with funding availability are primary bases for contract award. Cost realism and reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent appropriate. Concept papers will be accepted continuously through 2 April 2017. This BAA will remain open continuously through 30 April 2017. The BAA technical areas of interest are divided into the following groups: A. Medical Modeling, Simulation &amp; Mission Support; B. Warfighter Performance; C. Behavioral Sciences and Epidemiology; D. Deployment Health Research; E. Department of Defense HIV/Aids Prevention Program; F. Operational Infectious Diseases; G. Medical Science; H. Biomedical Translational Initiative; I. Warfighter Systems Technologies; J. Advanced Technology; K. Naval Medical Research Unit (NAMRU) Dayton, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH41; L. Navy Medical Research Unit (NAMRU) San Antonio, Brooks City -Base, TX; M. Naval Submarine Medical Research Lab (NSMRL), Groton, CT; N. Vitamin D, San Diego, CA; O. Clinical Decision Support and Healthcare Interoperability Technologies. All technical questions may be directed to the respective technical/administrative POC listed under each technical area of interest on the BAA.",
